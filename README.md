## Vendor Raise

Vendor Raise is a community-driven web platform that connects small business owners (vendors) with local lenders who are willing to provide small-scale financial support. This project is built for HackVortex 2025 â€“ FinTech domain.
# Deploy: https://vendoreraise.netlify.app/
## Project Idea

Many vendors and small shop owners struggle to access funds from banks due to strict policies or lack of documents. Vendor Raise solves this by connecting them directly with community lenders willing to provide small loans with flexible terms.

## Why Vendor Raise is Unique

Vendor Raise is special because it focuses on helping small shop owners and street vendors who usually donâ€™t get support from banks. Unlike other platforms made for big businesses, this is a simple, community-based website where local lenders can connect directly with vendors. It doesnâ€™t need heavy paperwork or high-tech skills. The platform is easy to use, supports local growth, and allows users to search based on loan type or location. Vendor Raise builds trust between real people and helps vendors raise money quickly, making it a unique solution for financial help at the community level.

**Problems I Faced**

   **While building Vendor Raise, I faced some challenges:**

   **No Backend Used**
   
I didnâ€™t use any backend, so I couldnâ€™t store user data like login details or loan requests. Everything is just on the frontend for now.

   **Limited AI Usage**
   
I used AI only a little â€” for writing content.

   **Time Limit**
   
I had less time, so I focused on design and pages instead of full functionality.

   **Connecting Users**
   
It was hard to show real interaction between vendors and lenders without backend or real data.


## Future Improvements

- Add backend using Node.js and MongoDB for real login and data storage.
- Create real-time chat between vendors and lenders.
- Add filtering/search functionality for location, loan type, amount.
- Secure user authentication with OTP/email verification.
- Use AI to match vendors with best-fit lenders.

## How to Run the Project

No backend or database is used, so login/registration are static pages only.
